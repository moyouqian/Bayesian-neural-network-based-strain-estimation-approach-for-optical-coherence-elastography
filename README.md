# Bayesian-neural-network-based strain estimation approach for optical coherence elastography

This is PyTorch re-implementation for Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks.The BNN is constructed based on the architecture of the U-Net++ . The Concrete dropout layers are added prior to every convolutional layers.
